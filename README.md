This code in python uses linear and polyomial regression analysis to understand the relationship between homelessness and rent for Austin Texas over time. Diagnostic tests are undertaken to determine autoregression. There is a feature to input future assumptions of rental prices to predict the potential number of homeless people in Austin. Of course, it is understood that the relationship is correlation but not causation, and this analysis is but one of many approaches to try to anticipate the potential need for homeless services in Austin in the future.
